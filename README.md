## the app has a full swagger documentation of the api at localhost:3000/api

## start the server and go to the documentation url

# notes

nestjs framework was chosen here to allow for easier documentation of the api using , swagger ui and nestjs/swagger i am able to document the whole api using decorators which is amazing.
it also allows for a scalable stable architecture which the nestjs framework provides through out of the box services like dependency injection.
